This perspective owes to the way that university accounts have been set up with aliases. What Does Email Alias Mean? An email alias refers to an email address that is associated with another destination email address. It enables using the email alias rather than the complete or original email address to send email to the corresponding email address or the recipient. The “true” account for all CSUSB faculty, staff and students always begins with the 9 digit Coyote ID. Let us consider the cases of a faculty member John Smith, whose ID is 001234567 and a student named Jane Wilson, whose ID is 007654321. Email All faculty and staff email addresses follow one of the following naming conventions – CoyoteID@csusb.edu or Firstname.Lastname@csusb.edu. Additionally, faculty and staff emails are Microsoft 365 email accounts. The “true” email address for John will be 001234567@csusb.edu. However, John will also have an alias email address of john.smith@csusb.edu . Anyone can send an email to either email address and it will go to the same mailbox. However, if John were to attempt to log on to Outlook, he will be required to use the true email address of 001234567@csusb.edu All student email addresses follow one of the following naming conventions - CoyoteID@coyote.csusb.edu or Firstname.Lastname9999@coyote.csusb.edu . Note the addition of the “coyote” in the email address. Also note that student email accounts are not Microsoft based, but instead are Gmail based. The “true” email address for Jane will be 007654321@coyote.csusb.edu. However, Jane will also have an email alias address of jane.smith4321@coyote.csusb.edu . Anyone can send an email to either email address and it will go to the same mailbox. However, if Jane were to attempt to log on to Gmail, she will be required to us the true account address of 007654321@coyote.csusb.edu . Also note that Jane cannot log on to a Microsoft 365 account, as student emails are Gmail accounts only. Microsoft Accounts If John or Jane want to access any Microsoft resource – i.e. Microsoft 365 Apps, Microsoft Teams, etc. both students and staff must login according to the same naming convention – CoyoteID@csusb.edu with no coyote included. John’s login would be 001234567@csusb.edu while Jane’s would be 007654321@csusb.edu Wireless/Eduroam Just as with Microsoft, logging in to the Wireless Network (Eduroam) requires using a username in the form CoyoteID@csusb.edu with no coyote included. John’s login would be 001234567@csusb.edu while Jane’s would be 007654321@csusb.edu Workstation/Lab Access For all users, student, staff or faculty, logging into a workstation or computer lab computer requires you use the combination of 9 Digit Coyote ID number and your MyCoyote Password. Google Workspace For Google Drive Access, staff and faculty will follow the convention of CoyoteID@csusb.edu while students will now have to add the “coyote” back in. John’s login would be 001234567@csusb.edu while Jane’s would be 007654321@coyote.csusb.edu Staff members who are also students For staff and faculty who are also students, for every resource except student email, use CoyoteID@csusb.edu as the login. Student Assistants If you are a student assistant but also have a staff email, you can access your staff (not student) email by using CoyoteID@csusb.edu Google access, either Google Drive or Student email, will still be CoyoteID@coyote.csusb.edu Note that, for the majority of campus resources, logging in requires the use of the nine digit Coyote ID, rather than the alias. For the majority of the time, logging in using the alias will result in being told your username and password are invalid. There is one exception: Adobe Apps Adobe apps, such as Creative Cloud, require that you log in using your email alias, rather than the combination of CoyoteID@csusb.edu or CoyoteID@coyote.csusb.edu You can find the specific email alias you are required to use by using the MyCoyote Portal Log on to the Personal Information Section of MyCoyote Select Email Addresses Staff and Faculty – use the business email Students – use the On Campus Email
