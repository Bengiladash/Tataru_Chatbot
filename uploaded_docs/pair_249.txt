Beginning August 2021, SOTE class attribute maintenance will be in CLSS. (Instructions on HOW TO EXCLUDE/INCLUDE CLASSES TO BE SOTED IN CLSS will be forthcoming.) SOTE is a class attribute added (or deleted) at the class section level. SOTE attributes copy forward in the prior term copy process for class section production each term. Since a SOTE row may already exist it may be necessary click on the “View All” link in the Class Attributes section to locate the SOTE row. NOTE: Please remember to remove the SOTE class attribute from field experiences, thesis research, distance learning through interactive televised video, independent project/study, recitations, and internship classes. Team-taught classes can be SOTED based upon instructor preference. Please confirm the team-taught classes have been marked correctly with (or without) the SOTE attribute.
