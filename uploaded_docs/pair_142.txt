This is because Ofice 365 allows you to attach documents from OneDrive. Office 365's OneDrive allows you to share documents with others in the cloud and the Office 365 web mail allows you to attach these cloud files in an email. To attach local files, compose a message in the Office 365 web mail and do the following. Go to Insert -> Attachments or OneDrive files. On the left-hand side select Computer to open a file from your local machine.
