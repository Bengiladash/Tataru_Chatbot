https://www.csusb.edu/its/support/it-knowledge-base/detail?id=9459b314a7ab0ef0dcb231454f981361468110e2a9 I received an e-mail message from Proofpoint. What is this message? You have received a "Spam Digest" report that is automatically generated from the Proofpoint system listing messages that are now being held in a special Quarantine. Once a day at 7 a.m., Monday through Friday, a digest message is sent showing a list of your new e-mail messages that have arrived from outside of CSUSB that appear to be spam. The report only includes messages added to the Quarantine since the last report was generated. A message placed in the Quarantine resides there for a month and then is automatically deleted from the Quarantine system.
