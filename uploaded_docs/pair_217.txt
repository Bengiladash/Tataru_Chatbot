Here are some of the reasons why Proofpoint is superior to the old spam filtering service: Every potential spam message (as identified by the Proofpoint system) is held in a special Quarantine after a month. In the new service, you maintain your personal lists of "Safe" senders and "Blocked" senders. You can request a new digest whenever you want right from the automatically generated daily digest. What else can I do? The system is defaulted to Tag and Pass spam detection. Options include: Tag and Pass (inconclusive email is tagged with a subject of [Spam]). Quarantine (holding any inconclusive emails with regular notifications). Aggressive (delete all spam including inconclusive spam; no quarantine).
