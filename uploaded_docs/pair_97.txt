That is, commercial email providers will require senders like CSUSB to be “DMARC aligned” before allowing delivery of csusb.edu email to their customers. Emails sent from typical locations (Faculty & Staff email, Canvas, PeopleSoft, etc.) will continue to work as before. Most will not notice the change. However, given the extensive history of email in higher education, we anticipate there may be unknown scenarios where email that used to be deliverable may now be filtered or blocked as spam. These situations, if detected and if being used for official university business, will require an ITS support request to correct. Possible situations may include: Third-party mailing lists and listservs. Sending as csusb.edu from a personal email account [3]. Forwarding your csusb.edu email to a personal email account. Desktop mail-merge software “Share via email” features on websites like newspapers, blogs, e-commerce, etc. The enforcement will require any email claiming to be from csusb.edu to be cryptographically signed (DKIM) and/or sent from a server listed as approved (SPF). We believe this will be a phased rollout, where senders may receive delivery status notifications (DSNs) with error messages like the ones below. 5.7.0 Email rejected per SPF policy 5.7.0 Email rejected per DKIM policy 5.7.0 Email rejected per DMARC policy If you believe legitimate csusb.edu email is being blocked, please Open a Support Ticket noting an unexpected non-delivery of email. Details such as from email address, recipient email address, date sent, subject, software used, etc. are all helpful in diagnosing the problem.
