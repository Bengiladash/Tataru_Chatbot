WARNING – If an emergency 911 call is placed using Jabber on a Windows or MAC computer, your location may not give accurate location data needed by 911. As a result, calls may be misdirected to the wrong emergency response center, or the emergency response center may make errors when determining your location. For data location to be provided immediately, we suggest using a cellular device or any other phone device. If you use your Jabber to dial 9-1-1 on a Windows or Mac device, please provide your exact location to assist emergency personnel.
