When you set a module prerequisite, the module is locked until a student completes the required items. However, unless completion requirements are set for prior modules, students will still be able to access upcoming modules. When selecting a prerequisite module, you can only choose from previous modules. You may need to reorder modules to correct prerequisite availability. Note: You can only add prerequisites if you have added at least one module. Open Modules In Course Navigation, click the Modules link. Edit Module Locate the name of the module and click the Options icon [1]. Select the Edit link [2]. Add Prerequisite Click the Add Prerequisite link. Set Prerequisite In the module drop-down menu, select the module students must complete before moving on. Manage Prerequisites To add additional prerequisites, click the Add Prerequisite link [1]. If you want to ensure students complete modules in order, you should add prerequisites for all modules that come before this module. To remove a prerequisite, click the Remove icon [2]. Update Module Click the Update Module button. Re-Lock Module If you change prerequisites that students have already fulfilled, Canvas will ask if you want to let students progress through the course or re-lock the modules and require students to complete the prerequisites again. To re-lock the modules, click the Re-Lock Modules button [1]. To allow students to continue without any changes, click the Continue button [2]. View Module View your prerequisite(s) in the module header.
