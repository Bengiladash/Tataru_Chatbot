They also allow you to easily and securely share these files and folders with others directly from the drive. Did you know... You already have access to OneDrive through your myCoyote portal? To access these drives, login to myCoyote, then select the 'Collaborate' tile. From here, you can launch OneDrive, as well as other collaboration tools. Sharing Files from OneDrive If your file is not already saved in your OneDrive, you’ll first need to upload it. Begin by selecting Upload from the tool-bar, and choose either Files or Folder, depending on the type of item you’d like to upload. Choose the item(s) you’d like to upload from your desktop, then select Open. Once your file(s) is saved to your OneDrive, you have the option to share it with others by either generating a shared link, or via email. Select the file you’d like to share, then select the Share button If you’d like to share the file(s) via email, type in the name or email address of the colleague you’d like to share the file with in the Send Link window, then select Send. An email will be sent to that individual, which will allow them to access the file/folder you shared with them. If you’d like to share the file with a shared link, select Copy Link. OneDrive will generate a shareable link that you can easily Copy and share with another individual. Still Need Assistance?
