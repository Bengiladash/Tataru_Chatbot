You can create a quiz using New Quizzes from the Quizzes page. You can create various types of content in each quiz. Learn more about New Quizzes. Note: New Quizzes is an opt-in LTI tool. If this tool is not available to you, please contact your Canvas admin. Open Quizzes In Course Navigation, click the Quizzes link. Note: You can also access quizzes from the Assignments page. Add Quiz Click the Add Quiz button. Create New Quiz In the Choose a Quiz Engine screen, select the New Quizzes option [1]. To save your quiz engine selection for this course, check the Remember my choice for this course checkbox [2]. Then click the Submit button [3]. Note: You can reset your quiz engine choice from the Quiz Options menu at any time. Edit Quiz Details In the Assignment Name field [1], enter the name of your quiz. To enter quiz details, enter the total points possible [2], select the assignment group [3], and choose how the grade is displayed to students [4]. To remove this quiz from final grade calculations, click the Do not count this assignment towards the final grade checkbox [5]. The points possible set on the assignment details page is the total points possible for the quiz. Points set per question determine points earned for correct answers. Points earned for correct answers are totaled and divided by the sum of the total question points for the quiz. That percentage is then used to calculate the final score based on the total points set on the assignment details page. For example, if you set the total points on the assignment details page to 50 and create an quiz with 10 questions each worth 1 point, the quiz has a total of 10 points but is worth 50 points when graded. If a student answers 9 questions correctly, their quiz score is 90% (9/10). However, their final score in the Gradebook will be 45/50 (90%). Assign Quiz In the Assign To field [1], select who will be required to take the quiz. You can assign the quiz to individual students or sections. In the Due field [2], select the quiz due date. In the Available from and Until fields [3], select the availability dates for the quiz. In progress quizzes automatically submit when the Until date and time passes.
