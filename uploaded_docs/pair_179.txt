If you would like to return the task bar to its left orientation, follow the steps below: Right click on any open space in the task bar, then click on Taskbar settings. This will take you to the Personalization > Taskbar screen. The option you're looking for can be found at the bottom of this screen: Taskbar behaviors. Expand this section by clicking on it, and then set the taskbar alignment to 'Left' and you're done.
