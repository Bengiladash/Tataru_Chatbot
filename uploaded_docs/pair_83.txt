When you use the below methods to restore Duo accounts on a new or replacement device, be aware that: Restoring or reactivating any "Duo-Protected" and "Duo Admin" accounts on the new device deactivates those accounts on the old device. Restoring any third-party accounts on the new device does not deactivate those accounts on the old device. Be sure to delete those accounts from Duo Mobile on the old device or delete Duo Mobile entirely from the old device once you verify the passcodes generated by the restored accounts work for logging in to those services.
