Please note these captions are not a substitute for live captioning accommodation requests, but could prove to be useful in many circumstances. If you have a live captioning accommodation request, please work with Services to Students with Disabilities. To enable automatic live captions in Zoom: Log in to your Zoom profile via myCoyote by choosing "Collaborate" and then "Video Conferencing". Select "Settings" from the left navigation menu. Select "In Meeting (Advanced)" Ensure the "Closed Captioning" option is toggled on, and select "Enable live transcription service to show transcript on the side panel in-meeting". Activating Automatic Live Captions Once you've updated your Zoom settings, the "Live Transcript" option will be present in meetings you host. To activate live captions, select "Live Transcript" and choose "Enable Auto-Transcription" from the menu. Captions will now be present at the bottom of the screen when participants speak. Participants can also view a full transcript on the right side of the screen by selecting "Live Transcript", then "View Full Transcript". Additional information can be found on our ATS Training page for enabling Zoom captions
