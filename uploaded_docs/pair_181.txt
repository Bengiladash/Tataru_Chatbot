JMP gives you 32 days of a grace period after you run JMP before it stops functioning. The JMP version on the CSUSB.EDU/SOFTWARE download page is currently JMP V15.0, The license for JMP V15 cannot be used to update an older version of JMP. If you try, you will get a “License key is invalid” message. You must run the INSTALL.BAT file as an administrative user. The work around is simple: Delete all traces of the JMP 15.0 program (run Uninstall on a PC, search for them on a Mac) and then re-install the downloaded version. It should work correctly, and the new one-year license will be auto-installed.
