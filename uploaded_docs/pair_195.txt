The recommended practice is to access PeopleSoft non-production environments using Cisco AnyConnect VPN client based on campus authorizations. The Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client provides secure VPN connections to the Unisys environment using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Our campus administrative users can access PeopleSoft non-production instances via ITS-Training Virtual Desktop (VDI) OR download the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client from the CMS Security page at https://csyou.calstate.edu/Projects-Initiatives/CMS/Infosec/Pages/SecHome.aspx to install the client on local desktop/laptop. For regular users who need to access CMS non-production environments occasionally, they can reach environments via ITS-Training Virtual Desktop, please watch the training video https://youtu.be/uQfRpYl0DkU first then following the steps from the training video. For Subject Matter Experts or power users, they can have the Cisco AnyConnect client installed on their local desktop/laptop. Please continue the reading or contact Technology Support Center by email support@csusb.edu or call 909/537-7677. For the first installation, you need administrative privileges. However, subsequent upgrades do not require the admin level privilege, and unlike the legacy IPSec VPN Client, a reboot is not required after an AnyConnect installation or upgrade. Installation/Upgrade Steps: Open the AnyConnect ZIP File and run Setup.exe. Important: Make sure you do not manually extract the files to a location, as this could cause problems with installation. Deselect all modules except “Core & VPN” and click the “Install Selected” button. Click the “OK” button. Read and accept the end user license agreement. The installation will complete after a few minutes. Click the “OK” button. After installing and opening the new client you will connect to: csslvpn1.dc.calstate.edu. You’ll be prompt to select a campus. Select San Bernardino from dropdown campus list. You’ll be prompted with campus single sign-on screen. Use your single sign-on credential to proceed. Select Accept.
