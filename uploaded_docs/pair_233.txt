To get your conference call started, just choose any of these methods: While on a call—convert the call to a conference call by clicking the More button on the call control strip, and then selecting the Conference Call option. From a group header—hover over a group header and click the call button to start a conference call with all of the available contacts in that group. From multiple contact selection—select the contacts that you want in your conference call and click the call button that appears when you hover over any of the selected contacts. You can add contacts to a conference call as follows: Search for contacts in the Add participants field. Drag contacts from your Contacts tab and drop them into the conference call window. WARNING – If an emergency 911 call is placed using Jabber on a Windows or MAC computer, your location may not give accurate location data needed by 911. As a result, calls may be misdirected to the wrong emergency response center, or the emergency response center may make errors when determining your location. For data location to be provided immediately, we suggest using a cellular device or any other phone device. If you use your Jabber to dial 9-1-1 on a Windows or Mac device, please provide your exact location to assist emergency personnel.
