Your digest reports should only contain the list of messages that have been quarantined since the last reporting period. You can see the full list of quarantined messages if you request a digest report via the link in one of your previous digest reports. Currently, empty digest reports are sent out. If no messages that have come through addressed to you have been quarantined during the last reporting period, you will not get a digest report.
