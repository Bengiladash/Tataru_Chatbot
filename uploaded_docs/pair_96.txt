Two-Step Login (Duo) provides an additional layer of security when you log into some CSUSB systems. Two-Step Login, also known as two-factor authentication, helps protect sensitive data and guard against increasingly sophisticated email and online scams (e.g., phishing attacks) that can leave you vulnerable to identity theft. CSUSB has partnered with Duo to provide this service. Use the Duo Mobile app on your smartphone or tablet, if you don't have such a device, regular cell phones, landlines are also supported. Single-button hardware tokens (SBHTs) are also available. Please feel free to contact the Technology Support Center at (909)537-7677 or at Support@csusb.edu if you have any questions.
