No, but you can choose a spam policy that is less restrictive. The system is defaulted to Tag and Pass spam detection. Other options include: Tag and Pass (inconclusive email is tagged with a subject of [Spam]). Quarantine (holding any inconclusive emails with regular notifications). Aggressive (delete all spam including inconclusive spam; no quarantine).
