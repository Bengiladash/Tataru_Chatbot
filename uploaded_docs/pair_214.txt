CSUSBâ€™s anti-spam solution (Proofpoint) is effective, but not perfect. We have seen a small number of instances where a legitimate message receives a spam score high enough to be quarantined or deleted (depending on your policy). If you believe that you are not receiving messages that you should, please contact the Technology Support Center (TSC) (909) 537-7677.
